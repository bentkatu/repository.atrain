    This should be at the top of your code to declare the type of text

    This is where you'd put your license details, the GPL3 license

    and improve upon your code. If you're re-using others code ALWAYS
    check the license first, removal of licenses is NOT allowed and you
    generally have to keep to the same license used in the original work
    (check license details as some do differ).

    Although not all licenses require it (some do, some don't),
    you should always give credit to the original author(s). Someone may have spent
    months if not years on the code so really it's the very least you can do if
    you choose to use their work as a base for your own.

    SECTION 5:
    Add our custom functions in here, it's VERY important these go in this section
    as the code in section 6 relies on these functions. If that code tries to run
    before these functions are declared the add-on will fail.

    You'll notice each function in here has a decorator above it (an @route() line of code),
    this assigns a mode to the function so it can be called with Add_Dir and it also tells
    the code what paramaters to send through. For example you'll notice the Main_Menu() function
    we've assigned to the mode "main" - this means if we ever want to get Add_Dir to open that
    function we just use the mode "main". This particular function does not require any extra
    params to be sent through but if you look at the Simple_Dialog() function you'll see we send through
    2 different paramaters (title and msg), if you look at the Add_Dir function in Main_Menu()
    on line 106 you'll see we've sent these through as a dictionary. Using that same format you can send
    through as many different params as you wish.
